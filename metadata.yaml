description: On one level, this witty short story describes a future in which traditional
  gender roles are reversed and men have quite literally become enslaved to the capricious
  whims of their female masters. On another level, ""Love Story"" can be read as a
  satirical indictment of the increasing materialism that took hold of middle-class
  America in the 1950s.
